# Battleship

This project is a console application that allows you to play the classic game of Battleship on a 15x15 board. 

# Features

You have the flexibility to choose the number of ships you want to play with, ranging from 1 to 5, as well as the length of the ships, from 1 to 5.
Additionally, you have the option to place the ships manually or randomly on the board.

# Technologies Used

- C#

To start the game, simply run the application and follow the prompts to select the number and length of ships, and the placement method. Once the ships are placed, the game begins, and you will take turns with your opponent to guess the location of each other's ships. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

This Battleship game is implemented in C# and is a great way to improve your programming skills. Feel free to customize the game as per your requirements and make it more challenging.
